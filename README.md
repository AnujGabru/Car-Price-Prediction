1  Car Price Prediction

Determining whether the listed price of a used car is a challenging task, due to the many factors that drive
a used vehicle’s price on the market. The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that
can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases.
We implement and evaluate various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of
different makes and models across cities in the United States. Our results show that Random Forest
model and K-Means clustering with linear regression yield the best results, but are compute heavy.
Conventional linear regression also yielded satisfactory results, with the advantage of a significantly lower
training time in comparison to the aforementioned methods

2 Problem Statement

A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their
manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and
European counterparts. They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand
the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand
the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very
different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know: Which variables are
significant in predicting the price of a car How well those variables describe the price
of a car Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset
of different types of cars across the American market. 

3 Project Description

The objective of this thesis is to be able to predict used cars market value can help
both buyers and sellers. There are lots of individuals who are interested in the used
car market at some points in their life because they wanted to sell their car or buy a
used car. In this process, it’s a big corner to pay too much or sell less then it’s
market value.
